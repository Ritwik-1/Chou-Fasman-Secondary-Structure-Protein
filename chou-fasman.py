# a) Provide a well commented code for the same. (30 marks)
# b) Display the output using the notation â€“ H: Helix, S: Beta strand. (10 marks)
# Chou and Fasman parameters to be used for the prediction are as following:


# For H : take two pointers i and j , j=i+6 and then i++ j++ till propensity scores are >= 4  
# or j >= len(string)
# basically see score(string[i:j] >= 4)
#if that is true then store this score and check for the element i-- and j++ if true then add 
#else i = j+1 and j = i+6
