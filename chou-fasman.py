# a) Provide a well commented code for the same. (30 marks)
# b) Display the output using the notation â€“ H: Helix, S: Beta strand. (10 marks)
# Chou and Fasman parameters to be used for the prediction are as following:


# Algorithm for Helix:-
# Take two pointers i and j , j=i+6 and then i++ till 
# we fins a window with propensity scores are >= 4 or j >= len(string)
# basically see score(string[i:j] >= 4)
# If we find a window with score >=4 then we check extensions both on the 
# left and right i.e. j+1,j,j-1,j-2 amino acids must have score >=4 for i+1 extension
# and i-1,i,i+1,i+2 must have score >= 4 for i-1 extension

# Algorithm for Beta sheet:
# same as helix , here we take a window of 5 and select 
# a window with score >= 3 for nucleation
# then for extension we take score >=4
# propensities are taken from the beta sheet dictionary
